The code is from chat gpt and basically the Halting Problem asks whether a given program will finish running or continue to run indefinitely for a particular input. It proves there is no general algorithm that can solve this problem for all possible program-input pairs.
def halting_problem(program, input_value):
    try:
        # This is a simplified representation; Python cannot evaluate arbitrary code directly.
        exec(program)
        return True  # If exec doesn't raise an error, we assume it halts
    except Exception:
        return False  # If exec raises an error, we assume it doesn't halt

# Example program that goes into an infinite loop
infinite_loop_program = """
while True:
    pass
"""

# Example program that halts
halts_program = """
print("This program halts.")
"""

# Test the Halting Problem (Note: this is a simplification)
print(halting_problem(infinite_loop_program, None))  # Output could indicate it doesn't halt
print(halting_problem(halts_program, None))
